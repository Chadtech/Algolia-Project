# Hi There

This is my Algolia project. In `resources/dataset` I have `combine-restaurant-data.coffee`, which produces restaurants.json. If you have coffeescript on your system you can run it with the command `coffee combine-restaurant-data.coffee`.

In `assets/scss/main.scss` is where I did all my styling.

I have some code going on in `assets/js/main.js`, but the primary app code is in `assets/elm`. Its written in a programming language called Elm.

If you want to get this running locally, try
```
npm install
elm package install
gulp
```
